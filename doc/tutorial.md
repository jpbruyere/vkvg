This tutorial shows how a sample of the vkvg library is coded from the ground up and how one creates an application based on vulkan which interacts with this library. Throught this document you will be refered to online documentation whenever necessary. The full cpp file is located [here]((/sample_1.cpp)), follow the code as you read this document.

Necessary steps to follow the tutorial
1. Complete the steps necessary to build the library.
2. Have a C++ compiler compatible with C++17.
3. Set up the project according to your development environment.
4. To understand the nomenclature use throught the document take a look through [Alexander Overvoorde](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) tutorial

This document is simillar to the tutorial developed by [Alexander Overvoorde](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) but it uses a nomenclature simillar to the one introduced in the Vulkan samples. 

To start we create a vulkan instance throught the function
```batch
init_instance();
```

This initializes the Vulkan library.

The following call provides a callback function to receive feedback from the Vulkan layers.
```batch
setupDebugMessenger();
```

To print to the screen create the surface associated with your operating system through the GFLW library by calling
```batch
init_surface();
```
Until now all function calls are simillar to the ones written by Alexander. The first divergence comes while selecting the queue families which will be used to present and to process the graphics processing necessary by this application. To simplify the tutorial the queue family of the physical device must support both graphics and presentation information as it is request in the following function: 

```batch
	QueueFamilyIndices findQueueFamilies(VkPhysicalDevice device) {
		QueueFamilyIndices indices;

		uint32_t queueFamilyCount = 0;
		vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties(device, &queueFamilyCount, nullptr);

		std::vector<VkQueueFamilyProperties> queueFamilies(queueFamilyCount);
		vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties(device, &queueFamilyCount, queueFamilies.data());

		int i = 0;
		for (const auto& queueFamily : queueFamilies) {

			VkBool32 presentSupport = false;
			vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR(device, i, surface, &presentSupport);

			if ((queueFamily.queueFlags & VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT) && presentSupport ) {
				indices.graphicsAndPresentationFamily = i;
				break;
			}
			i++;
		}

		return indices;
	}

```

With the physical device select one can create the logical device through the function call:

```batch
createLogicalDevice();
```

The second divergence from Alexander comes with the swapchain creation. To interact with GFLW surface, vkvg requires support for copy operations in the function:
```batch
querySwapChainSupport();
```
To support copy operations between vkvg and the tutorial, the internal image representations must be equal. This means that while calling the function chooseSwapSurfaceFormat() one should request a VkSurfaceFormatKHR equal to VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM or terminate the application otherwise.

To establish the link between the internal memory block used by the vkvg surface and the swapchain the struct VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR must be have the imageUsage field changed to both color attachment and as a destination of memory copies from the vkvg surface as seen in the following block of code:

```batch
VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR createInfo{};
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_INFO_KHR;
createInfo.pNext = NULL;
createInfo.flags = 0;
createInfo.surface = surface;
createInfo.minImageCount = imageCount;
createInfo.imageFormat = surfaceFormat.format;
createInfo.imageColorSpace = surfaceFormat.colorSpace;
createInfo.imageExtent = extent;
createInfo.imageArrayLayers = 1;
createInfo.imageUsage = VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT | VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT;
createInfo.imageSharingMode = VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE;
createInfo.queueFamilyIndexCount = 0; 
createInfo.pQueueFamilyIndices = NULL;
createInfo.preTransform = swapChainSupport.capabilities.currentTransform;
createInfo.compositeAlpha = VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR;
createInfo.presentMode = presentMode;
createInfo.clipped = VK_TRUE;
createInfo.oldSwapchain = NULL;
```
After creating the swapchain one must check that the format properties of the physical device support the tilling features required by vkvg. Assuming that the library was built with the
